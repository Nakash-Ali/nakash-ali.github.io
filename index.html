      About Me
      </h3><br/>

      <p>I aspire to fuse technology and innovation in order to improve the quality of life of people living in   unacceptable circumstances in developing
      and war-torn countries. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the University of  Waterloo. I have a passion for
      software development and have thorough experience with object oriented programming, in C++, C# and Java, UI design  and gate-level circuit design
      and web development skills in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. I have previously worked as a program developer at   Carleton University and in multiple
      roles at Diamond Trust Bank, Kenya.

      Apart from software development, hardware design and humanitarian development, I also possess great interests in  other areas. One of these is sports.
      Not only do I play table-tennis, soccer, cricket and basketball, I am also fond of indulging myself in the world of   soccer by regularly playing FIFA
      video games and supporting Liverpool Football Club.

            <hr>
            UHAI is a community service group, that I co-founded, which aims to improve the quality of life of the people living in the rural areas of Kenya. UHAI's greatest achievement was providing Pungu Primary School with access to clean water, which was a commodity the school had been lacking.
