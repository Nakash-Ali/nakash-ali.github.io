      About Me
      </h3><br/>

      <p>I aspire to fuse technology and innovation in order to improve the quality of life of people living in   unacceptable circumstances in developing
      and war-torn countries. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the University of  Waterloo. I have a passion for
      software development and have thorough experience with object oriented programming, in C++, C# and Java, UI design  and gate-level circuit design
      and web development skills in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. I have previously worked as a program developer at   Carleton University and in multiple
      roles at Diamond Trust Bank, Kenya.

      Apart from software development, hardware design and humanitarian development, I also possess great interests in  other areas. One of these is sports.
      Not only do I play table-tennis, soccer, cricket and basketball, I am also fond of indulging myself in the world of   soccer by regularly playing FIFA
      video games and supporting Liverpool Football Club.
