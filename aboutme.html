		<h1>
		About Me
		</h1>
		<p>I aspire to fuse technology and innovation in order to improve the quality of life of people living in unacceptable circumstances in developing
		and war-torn countries. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I have a passion for
		software development and have thorough experience with object oriented programming, in C++, C# and Java, UI design and gate-level circuit design
		and web development skills in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. I have previously worked as a program developer at Carleton University and in multiple
		roles at Diamond Trust Bank, Kenya.
		</p>
		<p>
		Apart from software development, hardware design and humanitarian development, I also possess great interests in other areas. One of these is sports.
		Not only do I play table-tennis, soccer, cricket and basketball, I am also fond of indulging myself in the world of soccer by regularly playing FIFA
		video games and supporting Liverpool Football Club.
		</p>
		<p>
		If I can be of any help to you, or if you seek to converse with me about intellectual topics or mutual interest, please do not hesitate to contact me.
